## Writing Best Practices

### Voice & Tone
- ✅ **Professional but authentic** - Be yourself, not a corporate robot
- ✅ **Conversational** - Write like you're talking to a colleague
- ✅ **Confident but humble** - Share expertise without arrogance
- ✅ **Positive energy** - Even when discussing challenges, end with solutions

### Formatting Tips
- **Use line breaks** - White space improves readability
- **Emojis sparingly** - 1-3 max, use strategically (🎯 📊 💡 ✅)
- **Bold text** - Use **asterisks** for emphasis on key points
- **Lists** - Numbered or bulleted lists are scannable
- **Short sentences** - Easy to digest, especially on mobile

### Language Do's
- ✅ Use "I" and "you" - Personal and direct
- ✅ Active voice - "I built" not "It was built"
- ✅ Specific examples - Concrete beats abstract
- ✅ Action verbs - Strong, clear language
- ✅ Industry terms - But explain if needed

### Language Don'ts
- ❌ Corporate jargon - "Synergy," "leverage," "circle back"
- ❌ Overused phrases - "Game-changer," "disruptive"
- ❌ All caps - Looks unprofessional
- ❌ Excessive exclamation points!!!
- ❌ Salesy language - Don't pitch directly

## Visual Elements

- **Infographics** - Data visualization performs well
- **Behind-the-scenes** - Real moments resonate

### Video Content
- **Native video** - Upload directly to LinkedIn (not YouTube links)
- **First 3 seconds** - Critical hook moment
- **Captions** - Many watch without sound
- **Length**: 30 seconds to 3 minutes ideal

### Carousels (Document Posts)

### Posting Frequency

- **Consistency matters more than frequency**

### Time Zone Considerations

## Engagement Strategies

### Before Posting
1. **Engage with others first** - Comment on 5-10 posts before posting

### Comment Strategy
